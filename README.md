# Examples of Multi-Layer Shallow Water Equation Solutions

This repository is a set of 1D and 2D examples for the use of solvers included in Clawpack, PyClaw and GeoClaw of the multi-layer shallow water equations.  1D solutions are written using PyClaw and the 2D versions use GeoClaw.  This is also a submodule of the apps repository included within the Clawpack group.
